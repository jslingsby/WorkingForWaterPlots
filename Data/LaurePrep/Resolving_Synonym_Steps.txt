List of the steps used to resolve the synonym errors and issues

1) Jasper compiled all species names (from community data, trait data, cape peninsula 
	species list)

2) Jasper used the webservice TNRS to remove typos

3) Doug checked remaining uncertain species id ("Data/Raw/spcID_and_synonyms/Copy of 
	Synonyms_for_Doug_WfW_5Sep2016 (2)")

4) Doug found a file with some specie name correspondances ("Data/Raw/spcID_and_synonyms/
	specimen id's")

5) Laure used Jasper's results to create a file allowing the correspondance between 
	original names and best solution for synonymy resolving ("Data/LaurePrep/Synonym_List
	_LaureProposition_29July16.xls")

6) Laure updated her previous file with Doug's suggestions and correspondances from the 
	newly found file ("Data/LaurePrep/Synonym_List_LaureProposition_UpdateWithDoug
	Comments4Oct16")
