Notes for synonym checking

1) Names from all datasets were extracted, combined, “uniqued”, sorted alphabetically to create one list and run through the Taxon Name Resolution Service (http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/)

2) Where the name was perfectly matched (TNRS_Overall_score = 1) the TNRS_Accepted_name was used, unless the species does not occur in the Cape (i.e. the name recorded was wrong, but matched another accepted species name).

3) Where full species names with collection numbers were recorded they were assigned the full species name (i.e. TNRS_Accepted_name)

4) Where genus names with collection numbers were recorded the “Original” name (i.e. Genus + collection number) was retained as it may allow discerning the species from other indeed species in the same genus.

5) Where genus name and a good descriptor were given - e.g. Pentameris tiny flower the “Original” name was kept.

6) Where genus names were given without species or collection number they were lumped to genus.

7) Names were checked for spelling and occurrence on the Cape Peninsula using http://redlist.sanbi.org/, http://posa.sanbi.org/ and a species list for the Cape Peninsula obtained from Tony Rebelo.

Check throughout: 
Morea - Moraea
Pentaschistis - Pentameris (make them all Pentaschistis?)
Satirium - Satyrium
Bolusafra - Fagelia
Peucedanum - Notobubon
Stoebe - Seriphium
Rhus - Searsia
Robsonodendron maritimum - Cassine maritima (check which is correct)
